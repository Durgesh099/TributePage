<h4>
1. You have to dream before your dreams can come true.
Most people, they raise a family, earn a living, and then they die. Never follow them.</h4>
<h4>
2. A dream is not that which you see while sleeping, it is something that does not let you sleep.
Dreaming is the first step towards achieving a goal.</h4>
<h4>
3. You should not give up and we should not allow the problem to defeat us.
Difficulties are part of life. They are there to prepare you, increase you, and develop you.</h4>
<h4>
4. If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun.
The only thing that’s stopping you is YOU. Rests are just excuses.</h4>
<h4>
5. I was willing to accept what I couldn’t change.
It’s very important for you to believe that you are the one.</h4>
<h4>
6. All of us do not have equal talent. But, all of us have an equal opportunity to develop our talents.
The sad truth is that the opportunity doesn’t knock twice.</h4>
<h4>
7. Man needs difficulties in life because they are necessary to enjoy success.
Sometimes we look at broken pieces in our lives. The key is what we do in our tomes of pain.</h4>
<h4>
8. Don’t take rest after your first victory because if you fail in second, more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.
Life has a way of pushing our dreams down. Don’t let first victory burry your biggest dream.</h4>
<h4>
9. Let us sacrifice our today so that our children can have a better tomorrow.

We must globally warm our hearts and change the climate of our souls, and realize that we are not apart from nature.</h4>
<h4>
10. I am not handsome but I can give my hand to someone who needs help… Because beauty is required in the heart, not in face…
Beauty isn’t dependent on our external appearance. It radiates from within.</h4>
